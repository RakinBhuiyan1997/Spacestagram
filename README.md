# Spacetagram!

Welcome to spacetagram! Where you can learn interesting new things about whats happening outside of our earth. This application uses Nasa's API to find all our data! This project was done as a tech-challenge for Shopify's internship program starting in Fall 2022!

### `Positive notes on doing this project`

Learning and exploring Nasa's differnt API's was a highlight of this project. Seeing the several options that NASA has to offer with loads of information to give was very educational.

One of my favorite things in this project was solving for the date selector to choose specific dates to render out certain pieces of data accoring to the range of dates placed!

### `Learning moments in this project`

One of the challenges I found myself facing during this project was definetly reading up the documentation on the API and how it works. Once I've gained a proper understanding of the documentation I was finally able to fetch my data properly.

Another one of my challenges was some CSS styling difficulites when it came to flex-box! Revisiting and reviewing flex-box allowed me to shape my application the way I wanted it to be.

### `What I would improve on this project`

One of the things I would imporve on this project would definetly be the CSS. Looking back into it, I definetly believe I can modernize the CSS alot more following examples of Instagram and even other blog websites!

I would also incorporate different API's into my application and allow users to choose while API they would like to view the data from. This would be done using API's with similar document of my APOD.
